<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Yashpal Gahlot. I have interest in businesses. I want to be an entrepreneur who has created a lot of value in life's of Indians.
  Right now I am 23 years old and currently I do not own any profitable business but I strongly believe that I will make it to the TOP.
</p>

<p>Done graduation from IIT Roorkee and was placed at Societe Generale as an Analyst on 02/12/2021 and on 3rd dec Aryan came to pick me to work on a 
  startup. I was a kid and I did not see that amount of money till then, Got very attracted to the luxuries and benefits. Started a company AESU 
  Healthcare Private Limited in health tech space. I believed that Sanjeev Ji is a businessman and will guide for success but I was able to see that 
  this company is going no where but then also dropped my placement just because I gave a word to Mr. Sanjeev that I will not leave this in between.

  After AESU journey, managed whole operations of worldcoin in India. It was also one of a kind experience. I was a kid with full energy and no sense of legal
  criticalities. So Worldcoin has hired multiple Orb operator companies to operate their orbs. Sparklehood and Mixsquads were the two operator companies in 
  India. Worldcoin has also hired a Market Manager Pulkit Gupta to oversee and help the orb operator companies for smooth running of the operations.
  At the peak every single orb of both these companies were under my control.
